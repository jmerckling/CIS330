Battle Ship game general rules and setup:
For my battle ship you have five total ships they are the Patrol Boat, Destroyer, Submarine, Battle Ship, and the Aircraft Carrier.
Each ship is represented by the numbers 1-5, in the order they are listed above respectively.
To set up your owwn board open "board1.txt" and/or for a two player game "board2.txt". Place your numbers representing the ship in a 10x10 grid
with 0s to represent water, the ships get to take up two, three, three, four, and five grids respectively, for example to place your Destroyer
represented by '2' and takes up three spaces you would put "222" horizontally or vetically in your grid.

Important note: when entering in coordinates to fire on you must use capital leters to represent the column, also you are allowed to fire
upon the same position twice the result will not change, but this is intentional.
